# hierarchical-algorithms

STL-Algorithms optimized for sequences with hierarchical structure
==================================================================

This code is an update of the code used for my [talk about hierarchy-aware algorithms] (http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/tv15/items/20.html)  at MeetingC++ 2015.

TODO
----
- documentation of the core ideas (currently you have to take the [slides] (http://meetingcpp.com/tl_files/mcpp/2015/talks/meetingc++2015-guntramberti.pdf)  as docu)
- clean up (namespaces etc)
- extend nested_accumulate to reductions returning iterators (max_element)
- check in benchmark code

If you are interested in this topic, please contact me.
