# hierarchical-algorithms

STL-Algorithms optimized for sequences with hierarchical structure
==================================================================

This code is an update of the code used for my [talk about hierarchy-aware algorithms] (http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/tv15/items/20.html)  at MeetingC++ 2015.

The core code is in the headers in hier-algorithms.
Some older direct versions are in hier-algorithms/direct.
There are simple tests in tests/ and a benchmark in benchmarks/


TODO
----
- documentation of the core ideas (currently you have to take the [slides] (http://meetingcpp.com/tl_files/mcpp/2015/talks/meetingc++2015-guntramberti.pdf)  as docu)
- extend nested_accumulate to reductions returning iterators (max_element)
