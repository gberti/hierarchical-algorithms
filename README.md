# hierarchical-algorithms

STL-Algorithms optimized for sequences with hierarchical structure

This code is an update of the code used for my talk about hierarchy-aware algorithms at MeetingC++ 2015, see http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/tv15/items/20.html

TODO
- clean up (namespaces etc)
- extend to reductions returning iterators (max_element)
- check in benchmark code
